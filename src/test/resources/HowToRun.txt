1. Running a Single Test Class:
mvn test -Dtest=YourTestClassName

2. Running a Single Test Method:
mvn test -Dtest=YourTestClassName#yourTestMethodName

3. Running Multiple Test Classes or Methods:
mvn test -Dtest=TestClassOne,TestClassTwo#methodA

=======================  Using Wildcards: ============================

1. To run all tests in classes starting with "Integration":
 mvn test -Dtest=Integration*

2. To run all methods starting with "test" in a specific class:
mvn test -Dtest=YourTestClassName#test*

Note: Ensure you are in the root directory of your Maven Spring Boot project when executing these commands.

===========================================================================================================================
Run only unit tests:
mvn clean test


Command to run only integration tests
mvn failsafe:integration-test failsafe:verify


Regarding Coverage (this will run both unit test and integration test and will do the jacoco coverage)

mvn clean verify

Note: This covers unit and integration test coverage as long as they run in the same Maven lifecycle (e.g. during verify).
